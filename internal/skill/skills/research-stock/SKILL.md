## How to research (use your tools — never ask the user for URLs)

1. Resolve what was asked into symbols. Japanese names work directly:
   日経平均/Nikkei→`^N225`, TOPIX→`1306.T` (ETF proxy), ドル円→`USDJPY=X`;
   a 4-digit code is a Tokyo-listed stock (`7203` → Toyota). US tickers (NVDA,
   MU) work as-is.
2. `MarketQuote` for the latest price and day change.
3. `MarketHistory` (`range=5d` for ~1 week, `range=1mo` for a month) for the
   recent move and trend; report the period change with concrete numbers.
4. `MarketNews` (optionally filtered) for the themes driving it; `WebFetch` a
   headline link when a detail matters.

## Report format (mobile-friendly, < 2000 chars)

- **Price & move**: latest price, day change, and the period change (state the range).
- **What's driving it**: 1–3 bullet points from the news, with the key theme.
- **Relations** (if multiple symbols): how they moved relative to each other
  (same sector? correlated or diverging?).

If the user asked you to remember the tickers (記録して / "track these"), persist
them with `MemoryWrite` (append to `MEMORY.md`, or `mode=overwrite` after
`MemoryGet` to keep a deduplicated watchlist) and confirm.

If no ticker was given, briefly say what you can research and give one example
(e.g. `/research-stock 日経平均` or `/research-stock NVDA, MU`).
